# E-commerce Synthetic Data

This project sets up the groundwork for generating and working with synthetic e-commerce datasets. It will eventually include:

- Scripts for creating realistic e-commerce datasets for testing and prototyping
- Utilities to ingest generated data into a local SQLite database
- Example SQL queries that demonstrate common analytics workflows on the dataset

## Current Structure

- data/: placeholder for generated datasets and intermediate assets
- db/: placeholder for SQLite files or migration helpers
- scripts/: placeholder for Python utilities (dataset generation, ingestion, helpers)
- sql/: placeholder for example SQL queries and snippets

## Getting Started

1. Activate the Python virtual environment:
   - Windows: env\\Scripts\\activate
   - macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

This repository currently only contains the scaffolding; implementation code will be added later.
